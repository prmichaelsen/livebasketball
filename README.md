# livebasketball scores_scraper
realtime basketball score scraping and notifications

it should be noted that this codebase is beyond terrible and, while, functional, should never EVER be used as a reference

## To Dos:
* technical debt
  * seperate classes out of main.java
  * integrate rest and scraper into one program
  * reduce code duplication, possibly by creating a core module
	* use jar resource access over direct file access where applicable
