# livebasketbal scores_scraper
realtime basketball score scraping and notifications

it should be noted that this codebase is beyond terrible and, while, functional, should never EVER be used as a reference

## To Dos:
* java client
  * wire up client REST calls
    * get leagues
    * update leagues
  * build up gui
    * display leagues
    * display checkboxes
  * wire up gui
 
* server
	* deploy current server files
	* get league ids for each match
	* only send notifications for selected leagues
  
* technical debt
  * seperate classes out of main.java
  * integrate rest and scraper into one program
